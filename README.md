 ### Hi there üëã
 Hello, my name is Andr√©, better known as DK. I've been researching programming for a few years now to make sure if this is what I want for my future, and I've discovered that it is. For me, programming is just a hobby for now, as I haven't started working yet since I'm still learning. My focus at the moment is learning Dart because I want to create applications in Flutter.

 My first contact with programming was on a Minecraft Bedrock server, where I learned programming logic using PHP, the language I used to create the server. I didn't learn much due to lack of time and a bit of laziness, haha, but I'm focusing on Flutter because I enjoyed creating mobile apps. I already have several projects in mind and I want to put them all into practice. For now, that's my story.
